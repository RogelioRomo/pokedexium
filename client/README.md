**POKEDEXIUM IS STILL IN WORKS SO SOME OF THE FEATURES MIGHT NOT ME AVAILABLE IF YOU ARE READING THIS MESSAGE.**

#Pokedexium

Hello there! Pokedexium is a fullstack personal project dedicated to show my ReactJS and Node.js skills.
It is a free to use pokedex with features like:

-Search for pokemon (all current Generations)
-Filter your search (type, gen and number range)
-Challenge pokemon (versus pokemon to see who has the advantage)
-Create teams and save them
-Go to your profile and change your account settings (password, email, username)

##Usage

To use pokedexium please follow the next steps:

1. By default the page redirects you to the login screen if you are not logged in. If you dont have an account please register yourself, you can click the link below to go to the register screen.
2. To register you will need to enter a username, an email, and your password. Don't worry, since is a portfolio project you dont need to enter real information, you can create any random email or password and it will work. 
3. Your password is encrypted so I will not know what are you entering, and the database will save it as encrypted so it will not save the real stuff.
4. Once registered, know you can login. Feel free to return to the login screen to do so.
5. Now you can explore the page freely. I tried to make the page as intuitive as possible so i am confident you will figure it out (its more fun that way ðŸ˜‰).
6. Please if you want to suggest any changes feel free to submit them via github, in the end this is an open source project. Enjoy Pokedexium!!!
